**Access the command line**

1. Accessing the command line through windows using "putty" to ssh into the red hat box. 

2. From linux to linux using ssh <username@ip address> and entering a password from there.


**Manage files from the command line**

ls -l = list all files, whoami = (self - directory I am in), pwd = what directory I am in 

d = directory 

cd / = home 

cd .. = back climbing through directory

-------------------------

to create a file, you must first go into the root, example. cd home, whoami, then cd into root, then touch (whatever file you want to create)

touch jerry = creates a file

touch krammer = creates a file 

check to see if the file was created using ls -ltr to list all directories and files in alphabetical order based on time and reverse order (so the newest one on the bottom).

cp jerry clark = copies an existing file and naming it clark

vi = creates a file that can be edited. but do not write anything in it because it can be a problem to get out. Press SHIFT WQ! and ENTER to exit out.
