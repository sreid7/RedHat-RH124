touch jerry = creates a file

touch krammer = creates a file 

touch dion nelson kyle = creating three files at the same time

check to see if the file was created using ls -ltr to list all directories and files in alphabetical order based on time and reverse order (so the newest one on the bottom).

cp jerry clark = copies an existing file and naming it clark

vi = creates a file that can be edited. but do not write anything in it because it can be a problem to get out. Press SHIFT WQ! and ENTER to exit out. 

mkdir = making a directory
